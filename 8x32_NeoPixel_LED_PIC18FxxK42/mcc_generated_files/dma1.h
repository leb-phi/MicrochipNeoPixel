  @Summary
    This function initializes DMA channel 1 instance : 

  @Description
    This routine initializes the DMA channel driver instance for : 
    index, making it ready for clients to open and use it. It also initializes any
    internal data structures.
    This routine must be called before any other DMA routine is called. 

  @Preconditions
    None.

  @Param
    None.

  @Returns
    None.
